# GoBanano
GoBanano is a Go implementation for Banano Node, it will implement the Banano Protocol including some Protocol Improvments for Security. For more details on Protocol Improvments see "Protocol Upgrade"

# Protocol Upgrade
The Protocol will be offically upgraded with a Canary Block, not decided yet. But in the meantime we will use a Upgrade process to mantain backwards-compatability with the Current Protocol. On the Node ID Handshake we will set a special flag that is ignored by C++ Banano Node but will be interpeted by GoBanano as a Protocol Upgrade and switch the Protocol.
